# Password Security
password: Strong passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols, {0}.
password: Consider using passphrases instead of passwords - they're longer but easier to remember, {0}. Example: 'PurpleTiger$JumpsOver42Clouds!'
password: Never reuse passwords across different sites, {0}. If one gets compromised, they all become vulnerable.
password: Password managers can generate and store complex passwords securely, {0}. They only require you to remember one master password.

# Phishing
phishing: Phishing emails often create urgency ('Your account will be closed!') or offer too-good-to-be-true deals, {0}.
phishing: Always check the sender's email address carefully, {0}. Scammers often use addresses that look similar to legitimate ones.
phishing: Hover over links before clicking to see the actual URL, {0}. If it looks suspicious, don't click!
phishing: Legitimate companies will never ask for sensitive information via email, {0}. When in doubt, contact the company directly.

# Malware
malware: Malware includes viruses, worms, trojans and spyware, {0}. Keep your antivirus updated and avoid suspicious downloads.
malware: Signs of malware infection include slow performance, pop-ups, and unexplained network activity, {0}.

# Ransomware
ransomware: Ransomware encrypts your files and demands payment for decryption, {0}. Regular backups are your best defense.
ransomware: Never pay ransomware attackers, {0}. There's no guarantee you'll get your files back, and it funds criminal activity.

# VPN
vpn: VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, protecting your data on public Wi-Fi, {0}. Choose reputable providers with no-log policies.
vpn: While VPNs enhance privacy, they don't make you completely anonymous online, {0}.

# Two-Factor Authentication
2fa: Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords, {0}. Use authenticator apps instead of SMS when possible.
2fa: Even if someone gets your password, 2FA can prevent them from accessing your account, {0}.

# Encryption
encryption: Encryption scrambles data so only authorized parties can read it, {0}. Look for HTTPS and the lock icon in browsers.
encryption: End-to-end encryption (like in Signal/WhatsApp) protects your messages even from service providers, {0}.

# Social Engineering
social engineering: Social engineering manipulates people into revealing information, {0}. Always verify identities before sharing details.
social engineering: "Hi, I'm from IT - what's your password?" is always a scam, {0}. Real IT never asks for credentials this way.

# IoT Security
iot security: Change default passwords on smart devices, {0}. Many IoT attacks exploit factory-set admin/password combos.
iot security: Keep IoT firmware updated, {0}. Unpatched devices are easy targets for botnets.

# Zero Day Vulnerabilities
zero day: Zero-days are unknown flaws that attackers exploit before patches exist, {0}. Reduce risk by limiting software privileges.
zero day: Organizations offer bug bounties for reporting vulnerabilities responsibly, {0}.

# Default Responses
default: I didn't quite understand that, {0}. I specialize in cybersecurity topics like passwords, malware, and network security.
default: I'm not sure about that, {0}. Ask me about protecting yourself online - I know lots about security best practices!

# Sentiment Responses
worried: I understand cybersecurity can feel overwhelming, {0}. Let's break this down into manageable steps.
worried: It's completely normal to feel concerned, {0}. The good news is there are simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
frustrated: I hear your frustration, {0}. Technology should work for you, not against you. Let me simplify this.
frustrated: Security can sometimes feel inconvenient, {0}, but these measures exist to protect what's important to you.
confused: Let me explain that differently, {0}. Cybersecurity concepts can be tricky at first.
confused: I'll break this down into simpler terms, {0}. Everyone starts somewhere with these concepts.
